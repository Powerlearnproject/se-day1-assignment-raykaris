Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Solution: Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and methods to the development of software 
            systems.
            Importance:
            1. Enables us(developers) to create anything, from  mobile apps, games to websites.
            2. Can be used to make a difference by solving real-world problems.
            3. It drives innovation and technological advancement, for example it led to creation of AIs, cloud computing, and IoT 
               devices.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Solution:
           1. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
           2. Development of programming languages such as C, and FORTRAN.
           3. Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Solution:
          a. Requirements
          Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
          b. Design
          Involves gathering detailed software design and user interface.
          c. Implementation
          Involves writing the codes and building the software according to the design specifications.
          d. Testing
          Refers to putting the software into test use to evaluate if it meets quality standards and functional requirements.
          e. Deployment
          This phase involves releasing the software to users or customers.
          f. Maintenance
          Involves providing support, updates, and enhancing the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Solution:
           Waterfall methodology uses a sequential and liner approach while agile methodology uses a iterative and incremental approach.
           Waterfall is less flexible since its hard to implement changes, while in agile, changes can be easily implemented.
           Testing in waterfall is done after deployment, while agile has continous testing and integration.
           Waterfall is used in systems such as banking and finance, government systems. Agile is applied in systems such as app 
           development and e-commerce platforms.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  Solution:
           (i.) Software developer -> responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
           (ii.) Quality Assurance engineer -> ensures the software is of quality, or meets the quality requirements.
           (iii.) Project manager -> oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Solution:
           IDEs are used for writing, debugging, and testing code. For example; Vscode, Eclipse.
           VCS are tools used for tracking changes to the source code. For example; Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Solution:
           challenges;
               - Changing requirements
               - Technical debt
               - Tight Deadlines
           mitigation strategies
               - Agile methodologies
               - Effective communication
               - Task prioritization
               - Regular assessment

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Solution:
           -> Unit Testing
              Involves testing individual components or modules.
           -> Integration Testing
              Testing interaction between different components or subsystems.
           -> System Testing
              Involves testing the entire system as a whole.
           -> Acceptance Testing
              Involves testing the software against user requirements.
          Importance
            These testing process help inidentification and fixing of problems/ errors early in the development process.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Solution:
           Prompt engineering refers to the act of crafting questions or statements to get the best response from an AI model.
           It's important as it acts as an intepretor between the user and the ai model, thus preventing generation of confusing answers 
           by simplifiying users prompts.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Solution:
           Vague prompt: Tell me about Kenya
           Clear prompt: Tell me about the fun facts of Kenya.
           In the first prompt, the ai will just give you general information about Kenya. While in the second prompt, you will get a 
           focused reponse.
